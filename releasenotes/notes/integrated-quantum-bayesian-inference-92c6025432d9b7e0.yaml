    The Qiskit Machine Learning library introduces the `QBayesian` class,
    implementing the Quantum Bayesian Inference algorithm. This new feature
    enhances the library's capabilities in quantum machine learning,
    particularly in the area of probabilistic reasoning and inference
    on quantum computers.

    Introduction of the `QBayesian` class in the Qiskit Machine Learning library.
    This class implements Quantum Bayesian Inference, allowing users to perform
    probabilistic reasoning with quantum circuits. The implementation is based on the
    algorithm described in the paper "Quantum inference on Bayesian networks"
    by Low, Yoder, and Chuang.

  - |
    The `QBayesian` class supports various functionalities including:
      - Initialization with a quantum circuit representing a Bayesian network.
      - Rejection sampling for estimating probabilities given evidence, with
        Grover's algorithm-based amplification.
      - Approximate Bayesian inference using rejection sampling,
        with Grover's algorithm-based amplification.

    The `13_quantum_bayesian_inference` notebook describes a tutorial for the
    usage of the `QBayesian` class

issues:
  - |
    Users should ensure that each register in the quantum circuit passed to
    `QBayesian` is mapped to exactly one qubit. The class raises a `ValueError`
    if this condition is not met.

upgrade:
  - |
    Users looking to leverage advanced probabilistic inference techniques in
    quantum computing can now use the `QBayesian` class. To use this feature,
    ensure that the latest version of the Qiskit Machine Learning library is installed.

other:
  - |
    The `QBayesian` class is a significant addition for researchers and practitioners
    working in quantum machine learning, particularly in the domain of Bayesian inference.
    It opens up new possibilities for complex probabilistic modeling on quantum computers.
