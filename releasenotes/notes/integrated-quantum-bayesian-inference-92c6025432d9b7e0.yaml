    Introduction of the `QBayesian` class in the Qiskit Machine Learning library.
    This class implements quantum Bayesian inference, allowing users to perform
    probabilistic reasoning with quantum circuits. The implementation is based on the
    algorithm described in the paper "Quantum inference on Bayesian networks"
    by Low, Yoder, and Chuang.
  - |
    The `QBayesian` class supports various functionalities including:
      - Rejection sampling for estimating probabilities given evidence, with
        Grover's algorithm-based amplification.
      - Approximate Bayesian inference using rejection sampling,
        with Grover's algorithm-based amplification.

    The `13_quantum_bayesian_inference` notebook describes a tutorial for the
    usage of the `QBayesian` class
